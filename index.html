    <h2>When i was a little kid, I had a pony that went by the name Tony.</h2>
    <img
      src="Assets/whitehorse.jpg"
      alt="A recent image of Tony with earcuffs."
      class="fancy"
      style="width: 350px; height: 300px; border-radius: 50px;"
    />
    <p>
      I was only 6 years old when i <em>first</em> met Tony, I will never forget
      the first time i met him. He was standing there in the sunshine with his
      shining white fur, it was <em>love</em> at <strong>first</strong> sight.
      Allthough he is not a pony anymore, I still love him
      <em><strong>just</strong></em> as much.
