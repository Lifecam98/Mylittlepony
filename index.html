    <p>
      I was only 6 years old when i <em>first</em> met Tony, I will never forget
      the first time i met him. He was standing there in the sunshine with his
      shining white fur, it was <em>love</em> at <strong>first</strong> sight.
      Allthough he is not a pony anymore, I still love him
      <em><strong>just</strong></em> as much.
