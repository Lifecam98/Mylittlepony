    <h2>When i was a little kid, I had a pony that went by the name Tony.</h2>

    <p>
      I was only 6 years old when i <em>first</em> met Tony, I will never forget
      the first time i met him. He was standing there in the sunshine with his
      shining white fur, it was <strong>love</strong> at <em>first</em> sight.
      Allthough he is not a pony anymore, I still love him <em>just</em> as
      much.
