              Horses are known for their strength, agility, and endurance. They
              can reach speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h). Horses are also
              known for their natural agility, which allows them to move quickly
              and efficiently in various situations.

            <li>
              Horses have a long, slender body, with a broad, tubular neck and
              shoulders. The horse's face is shaved, and its eyes are small and
              often have a pointed shape. The horse's legs are long, and they
              have a strong, powerful hoof.

            Horses are known for their ability to run, jump, and leap, which
            helps them reach their goal quickly. They also have a strong sense

            to 100 mph (160 km/h).

            Horses are known for their ability to produce milk, which is
            essential for their survival. They also have a strong sense of
