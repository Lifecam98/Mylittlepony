            Horses are large, muscular animals that primarily live in Africa,
            Asia, and South America. They are omnivores, meaning they eat meat,

            Horses are known for their strength, agility, and endurance. They
            can reach speeds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h). Horses are also known
            for their natural agility, which allows them to move quickly and
            efficiently in various situations.

          <li>
            Horses have a long, slender body, with a broad, tubular neck and
            shoulders. The horse's face is shaved, and its eyes are small and
            often have a pointed shape. The horse's legs are long, and they have
            a strong, powerful hoof.

        <li>
          Horses are known for their ability to run, jump, and leap, which helps
          them reach their goal quickly. They also have a strong sense of smell,
          which helps them find food. Horses can run at speeds of up to 100 mph
          (160 km/h).

        <li>
          Horses are known for their ability to mate and have a strong, socially
          structured society. They have a strong sense of social bonding and can
          form strong relationships with their fellow horses. Horses can have up
          to 100 children at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Horses are known for their ability to produce milk, which is essential
          for their survival. They also have a strong sense of hunger, which
          helps them find food. Horses can produce up to 10 liters (3.3 gallons)
          of milk per day.
